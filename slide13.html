            <li>Individuals with lower educational levels consistently exhibited higher rates of anxiety and depression symptoms.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Research by Ettman et al. (2021) indicates that Americans with lower incomes were more susceptible to depression due to financial stress related to COVID-19.</li>
