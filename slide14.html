        <h3>Summary of Findings:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Fluctuations in Mental Health Symptoms:</strong> The pandemic led to significant fluctuations in anxiety and depression rates among US adults from 2020 to 2024, with various COVID-19 milestones influencing these trends.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Educational Disparities:</strong> Individuals with lower educational attainment experienced higher rates of anxiety and depression, likely exacerbated by financial stressors such as job loss and inability to pay rent.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Demographic Disparities:</strong> Significant disparities were observed among different demographic groups, with transgender, bisexual, and individuals with disabilities reporting higher rates of mental health symptoms.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Age-Based Trends:</strong> Younger adults (18-29 years) consistently showed the highest rates of mental health symptoms, while older adults (60 years and above) exhibited lower rates, indicating better resilience or different stressors.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>State-Level Variations:</strong> Mental health impacts varied across states, with Southern states potentially experiencing more significant challenges during the pandemic.</li>
