        <h1>The Covid-19 Pandemic & Mental Health</h1>
        <p>In a 2-week analysis by Pew Research Center back in 2021, researchers found that 89% of Americans surveyed reported that the pandemic had brought about negative impacts and difficulties to their lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our case study hopes to expand on these findings by taking a closer look at depression and anxiety rates during and post-pandemic, aiming to understand the extent and persistence of mental health challenges in the US population.</p>
